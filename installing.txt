First-time setup of the CRM project:

1. In /web: copy index.php.develop, .release or .production index.php.
2. Create directory /web/assets/
3. Make sure /runtime/ and /web/assets/ are writable.
4. Place a Yii vendor directory as /vendor/. It is advisable to symlink this
   from a checkout of the yiiFramework.git repository.
5. Set up a web server with /web/ as the web root.
